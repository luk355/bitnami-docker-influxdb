## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

## How to deploy InfluxDB (TM) in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami InfluxDB (TM) Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/influxdb).

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami InfluxDB (TM) Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/influxdb).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/influxdb/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/influxdb:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/influxdb:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-influxdb.git#master:2/debian-10'
```

## Persisting your application

If you remove the container all your data will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

For persistence you should mount a directory at the `/bitnami/influxdb` path. If the mounted directory is empty, it will be initialized on the first run.

```console
$ docker run \
    --volume /path/to/influxdb-persistence:/bitnami/influxdb \
    --env INFLUXDB_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=false \
    bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

You can also do this with a minor change to the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-influxdb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```console
InfluxDB:
  ...
  volumes:
    - /path/to/influxdb-persistence:/bitnami/influxdb
  ...
```

## Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a different server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers and vice-versa.

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

### Using the Command Line

In this example, we will create a InfluxDB (TM) client instance that will connect to the server instance that is running on the same docker network as the client.

#### Step 1: Create a network

```console
$ docker network create my-network --driver bridge
```

#### Step 2: Launch the InfluxDB (TM) container within your network

Use the `--network <NETWORK>` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the container to the `my-network` network.

```console
$ docker run -d --name influxdb-server \
  --network my-network \
  --env INFLUXDB_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=false \
  bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

#### Step 3: Launch your InfluxDB (TM) client instance

Finally we create a new container instance to launch the InfluxDB (TM) client and connect to the server created in the previous step:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm \
    --network my-network \
    bitnami/influxdb:latest influx -host influxdb-server
```

### Using Docker Compose

When not specified, Docker Compose automatically sets up a new network and attaches all deployed services to that network. However, we will explicitly define a new `bridge` network named `my-network`. In this example we assume that you want to connect to the InfluxDB (TM) server from your own custom application image which is identified in the following snippet by the service name `myapp`.

```yaml
version: '2'

networks:
  my-network:
    driver: bridge

services:
  influxdb:
    image: bitnami/influxdb:latest
    environment:
      - INFLUXDB_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=false
    networks:
      - my-network
  myapp:
    image: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_IMAGE'
    networks:
      - my-network
```

> **IMPORTANT**:
>
> 1. Please update the `YOUR_APPLICATION_IMAGE` placeholder in the above snippet with your application image
> 2. In your application container, use the hostname `influxdb` to connect to the InfluxDB (TM) server

Launch the containers using:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Configuration

InfluxDB (TM) can be configured via environment variables or using a configuration file (`influxdb.conf`). If a configuration option is not specified in either the configuration file or in an environment variable, InfluxDB (TM) uses its internal default configuration.

- If you are using v1, variables must be prefixed by `INFLUXDB_`, find more [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/config/).
- If you are using v2, variables must be prefixed by `INFLUXD_`, find more [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/reference/config-options).

> Note: The settings at the environment variables override the equivalent options in the configuration file."

### Configuration file

The configuration can easily be setup by mounting your own configuration file (`influxdb.conf`) on the directory `/opt/bitnami/influxdb/etc/`:

```console
$ docker run --name influxdb \
    --volume /path/to/influxdb.conf:/opt/bitnami/influxdb/etc/influxdb.conf:ro \
    bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  influxdb:
    image: bitnami/influxdb:latest
    volumes:
      - /path/to/influxdb.conf:/opt/bitnami/influxdb/etc/influxdb.conf:ro
```


### Initializing a new instance

When the container is executed for the first time, it will execute the files with extensions `.sh`, and `.txt` located at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

In order to have your custom files inside the docker image you can mount them as a volume.

### Setting the admin password on first run

The admin user and password can easily be setup with the Bitnami InfluxDB (TM) Docker image using the following environment variables:

 - `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER`: The database admin user. Defaults to `admin`.
 - `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD`: The database admin user password. No defaults.

Passing the `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` environment variable when running the image for the first time will set the password of the `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER` user to the value of `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD`.

```console
$ docker run --name influxdb -e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=password123 bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-influxdb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  influxdb:
  ...
    environment:
      - INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=password123
  ...
```

**Warning** In case you want to allow users to access the database without credentials, set the environment variable `INFLUXDB_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=false`. **This is recommended only for development**. If you are using InfluxDB (TM) v2 authentication is required and `INFLUXDB_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED` will be ignored.

### Allowing empty passwords

By default the InfluxDB (TM) image expects all the available passwords to be set. In order to allow empty passwords, it is necessary to set the `INFLUXDB_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=false` env variable. This env variable is only recommended for testing or development purposes. We strongly recommend specifying the `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` for any other scenario. If you are using InfluxDB (TM) v2, authentication is required and `INFLUXDB_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED` will be ignored.

```console
$ docker run --name influxdb --env INFLUXDB_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=false bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-influxdb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  influxdb:
  ...
    environment:
      - INFLUXDB_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=false
  ...
```

### Creating a database on first run

If you are using InfluxDB (TM) v1 you can pass `INFLUXDB_DB` environment variable when running the image for the first time, a database will be created. This is useful if your application requires that a database already exists, saving you from having to manually create the database using the InfluxDB (TM) client.

```console
$ docker run --name influxdb \
    -e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=password123 \
    -e INFLUXDB_DB=my_database \
    bitnami/influxdb:1-debian-10
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-influxdb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  influxdb:
  ...
    environment:
      - INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=password123
      - INFLUXDB_DB=my_database
  ...
```

For If you are using InfluxDB (TM) v2 you can pass `INFLUXDB_USER_BUCKET` environment variable when running the image for the first time, a new bucket will be created. This is useful if your application requires that a bucket already exists, saving you from having to manually create the bucket using the InfluxDB (TM) CLI.

```console
$ docker run --name influxdb \
    -e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=password123 \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER_BUCKET=my_bucket \
    bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

### Creating a database user on first run

You can create a restricted database user that only has permissions for the database created with the [`INFLUXDB_DB`](#creating-a-database-on-first-run) environment variable. To do this, provide the `INFLUXDB_USER` environment variable and to set a password for the database user provide the `INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD` variable.

```console
$ docker run --name influxdb \
  -e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=password123 \
  -e INFLUXDB_USER=my_user \
  -e INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=my_password \
  -e INFLUXDB_DB=my_database \
  bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-influxdb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  influxdb:
  ...
    environment:
      - INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=password123
      - INFLUXDB_USER=my_user
      - INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=my_password
      - INFLUXDB_DB=my_database
  ...
```

You can also create users with restricted privileges in the database in a very similar way. To do so, user the environment variables below:

- `INFLUXDB_READ_USER`: Specify the user with "read" privileges in the database.
- `INFLUXDB_READ_USER_PASSWORD`: Specify the password of the `INFLUXDB_READ_USER` user.
- `INFLUXDB_WRITE_USER`: Specify the user with "write" privileges in the database.
- `INFLUXDB_WRITE_USER_PASSWORD`: Specify the password of the `INFLUXDB_WRITE_USER` user.

### Customize the HTTP port readiness

You can modify the timeout for the HTTP port readiness probe where the container waits until the HTTP port is actually ready to receive queries before finish the setup. Use `INFLUXDB_HTTP_READINESS_TIMEOUT` to do this.

```console
$ docker run --name influxdb \
  -e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=password123 \
  -e INFLUXDB_USER=my_user \
  -e INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=my_password \
  -e INFLUXDB_DB=my_database \
  -e INFLUXDB_HTTP_READINESS_TIMEOUT=30 \
  bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-influxdb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  influxdb:
  ...
    environment:
      - INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=password123
      - INFLUXDB_USER=my_user
      - INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=my_password
      - INFLUXDB_DB=my_database
      - INFLUXDB_HTTP_READINESS_TIMEOUT=30
  ...
```

- `INFLUXDB_HTTP_READINESS_TIMEOUT`: Spacify the time to wait until the HTTP endpoint is ready in seconds. Default: 60

## Logging

The Bitnami InfluxDB (TM) Docker image sends the container logs to `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
$ docker logs influxdb
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

## Maintenance

### Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of InfluxDB (TM), including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

#### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to `bitnami/influxdb:latest`.

#### Step 2: Stop and backup the currently running container

Stop the currently running container using the command

```console
$ docker stop influxdb
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose stop influxdb
```

Next, take a snapshot of the persistent volume `/path/to/influxdb-persistence` using:

```console
$ rsync -a /path/to/influxdb-persistence /path/to/influxdb-persistence.bkp.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H.%M.%S)
```

#### Step 3: Remove the currently running container

```console
$ docker rm -v influxdb
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose rm -v influxdb
```

#### Step 4: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```console
$ docker run --name influxdb bitnami/influxdb:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up influxdb
```
